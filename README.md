# 🍎 Food Recognition Tracker

**AI-Powered Nutritional Analysis Web Application**

A computer vision-powered web application that recognizes food items from images and provides detailed nutritional information including calories, macronutrients, and dietary data.

## 📋 Project Overview

- **Duration**: 8-10 weeks (Fall 2025 Ld Vision Cohort)
- **Goal**: Build a comprehensive food recognition system with nutritional tracking
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, Roboflow API, Kaggle dataset, MongoDB
- **Current Phase**: Week 1-2 MVP Implementation ✅

## 🎯 Phase 1: Foundation & MVP (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1 Milestone: Basic Pipeline Setup ✅
**Deliverables Completed:**
- [x] GitHub repository with clean structure
- [x] Flask app with image upload functionality
- [x] Integration with Roboflow food detection model
- [x] Kaggle fruit dataset integration using kagglehub
- [x] Basic HTML templates for upload and results
- [x] Working demo video (2-3 minutes)
- [x] Project documentation in shared Google Doc

**Success Criteria Met:**
- [x] User can upload food image
- [x] App returns raw JSON predictions
- [x] Code is modular and well-documented
- [x] Demo shows end-to-end functionality

### Week 2 Milestone: Nutrition Integration ✅
**Deliverables Completed:**
- [x] Integration with nutrition API (Nutritionix/Edamam)
- [x] Map detected food labels to calorie/macro data
- [x] Enhanced UI showing nutrition facts
- [x] Error handling for API failures
- [x] Expanded dataset testing with various food types

**Success Criteria Met:**
- [x] App converts "apple" detection to "95 calories, 25g carbs"
- [x] Clean nutrition display in web interface
- [x] Handles unknown foods gracefully

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Live Demo (Instant)
Open `index.html` in your browser to try the interactive demo with sample food recognition.

### Option 2: Full Setup (Development)
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Devendra-Reddy/food-recognition-tracker.git
cd food-recognition-tracker

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (already configured)

# Run the application
python app.py
```
